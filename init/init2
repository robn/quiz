# set the terminal size correctly.
#
# we're on an emulated serial port, which can't send SIGWINCH. we know though
# that there's almost certainly a vt100 on the other end of it, so we can ask
# it to help us out.
#
# here, we switch to raw input mode, and send:
#
#   \e7          DECSC  save cursor             (vt100)
#   \e[999;999H  CUP    move cursor to 999,999
#   \e[6n        DSR    report cursor position
#   \e8          DECRC  restore cursor          (vt100)
#
# the terminal responds to DSR by "typing" (_not_ stdin):
#
#   \e[<rows>;<cols>R
#
# note that the terminal does not "type" an enter, thus the need for raw input
# mode. the lack of a newline means that most line-based programs will block.
# but, sed in unbuffered mode will read the minimum required to run the
# program.
#
# so we run sed to match everything up to the R, then convert it into a stty
# command that will set the rows and columns. finally, we reset the terminal,
# and execute the command we built. and now the terminal is properly-sized.
# phew.
