# "tmux" rc, for easier interactive use.
#
# this script is run inside the "run" window, see rc/tmux/run for more info.
#
# this sets up a couple of quality-of-life improvements for the program run:
#
# - kernel messages are also displayed here, so they appear interleaved with
#   the program output, which is extremely useful if you're like me and do
#   a lot of print debugging in the kernel (which is like 90% of the reason
#   quiz even exists)
#
# - after the program run, waits for the user to do something before detaching
#   (and so exiting the VM). the user may want to examine the output before
#   exiting, but we also want to preserve the conceit that the program run and
#   the VM lifetime is the same. Without this, the run window would close,
#   losing the output, and leaving the user on the kernel log window. Instead,
#   we tell them where they're at, give them an instruction, and on exit,
#   call `tmux detach` to tear down the VM.
